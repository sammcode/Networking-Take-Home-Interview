*From Junior to Senior*
**Take Home Interview**

The goal of this project is to evaluate your skills as a developer using OOP design principles, networking intermediate knowledge, enums/generics and unit tests.

The project currently has 3 classes that are relevant:
- NetworkController: with a single `fetch` function. You will do most of your work here.
- NetworkPerson: parses the API response from `NetworkController.fetch`
- ViewController: empty for now

For this project you are required to do the following:
- All unit tests should pass.
- `ViewController` should have a single label, centered both in portrait and landscape, that shows the fetched NetworkPerson's name.

Other requirements:
- You may not modify the unit tests unless absolutely necessary.
- You may not modify `protocol NetworkPlaceholder`
- You may modify `NetworkController` as you see fit
- You may modify `ViewController` as you see fit
- You may add new helper objects, if you wish

This should not take more than 200 lines of code.

*Deliverable*
The deliverable has two components.
- A video of your app in action
- The source code of your app

Once you're done, check the solution video attached to grade your own solution.
